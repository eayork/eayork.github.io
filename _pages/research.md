<h4>Dissertation Project</h4>

Elected institutions are increasingly a fixture of autocracies: today, roughly 85% of autocratic regimes select legislative deputies through regular national elections. Previous research has produced a number of explanations for the spread of institutional autocracy, but there is still much we do not understand about how governance works in such settings.
In my primary research agenda, I examine the ways in which institutions borrowed from democracies impact the political playing field under autocracy.

In a set of empirical papers, I show that institutional authorities create space for opposition participation and allow them to compete with regime parties to attract voter support. For this work, I draw on a novel dataset of more than 38,000 unique written and oral questions submitted by Moroccan MPs during the 2011-2016 parliamentary session, as well as qualitative data gleaned from interviews with current and former parliamentary deputies and civil society actors over approximately seven months of field work between 2015 and 2018.

In a separate paper, I develop a formal model of policy bargaining to study how the autocrat's checks over the legislature impact redistribution in his favor and ensure coalitional stability.
