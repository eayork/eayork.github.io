    <h4>Dissertation Project</h4>

<p>Elected institutions are increasingly a fixture of autocracies: today, roughly 85% of autocratic regimes select legislative deputies through regular national elections. Previous research has produced a number of explanations for the spread of institutional autocracy, but there is still much we do not understand about how governance works in such settings.
In my primary research agenda, I examine the ways in which institutions borrowed from democracies impact the political playing field under autocracy.</p>

<p>In a set of empirical papers, I show that institutional authorities create space for opposition participation in government and allow them to compete with regime parties to attract voter support. For this work, I draw on a novel dataset of more than 38,000 unique written and oral questions submitted by Moroccan MPs during the 2011-2016 parliamentary session, as well as qualitative data gleaned from interviews with current and former parliamentary deputies over seven months of field work between 2015 and 2018.</p>

<p>In a separate paper, I develop a formal model of policy bargaining to study how the autocrat’s checks over the legislature impact redistribution in his favor and ensure coalitional stability.</p>

    <p>How does the opposition in an authoritarian setting mobilize turnout when it lacks regime connections ostensibly required to deliver private goods to its supporters? The regime possesses an extensive set of strategies to incentivize electoral support for its preferred candidates, yet opposition parties often achieve significant electoral successes. I argue that institutional channels help to level the playing field between regime and opposition candidates in developing autocracies. Though regime candidates may have the ear of those in power through backdoor channels and personal connections, opposition politicians can use ‘by the book’ politics – the legitimate authorities that accompany their office – to ensure the supply of constituency goods. I draw on a vast database of activity from recent legislative terms in Morocco, including more than 38000 unique written and oral queries submitted by elected members of parliament, and identify a strong linkage between activity in office and subsequent electoral outcomes. Voters reward parties and deputies that engage in more constituency service via institutionalized action. 
But the relationship between activity and vote share is exclusive to opposition parties: regime-linked parties do not see electoral gains from increased legislative activity, but neither are they punished for shirking in office.</p>

    <p>Autocrats use institutions to ‘coopt’ members of the opposition and neutralize their threat as outsiders. But given the extremely minor policy concessions typically offered through such mechanisms and the threat to their credibility posed by alliances with the regime, why do opposition actors allow themselves to be coopted? I argue that institutional features of autocracy – specifically, the fact that legislatures lack rigorous checks on the executive branch – create non-policy-related benefits to participation in government. In Morocco, a constitutional monarchy, the constitution grants elected members of parliament the authority to make requests of government ministers, but it does not require that ministers respond. As a result, responsiveness – and, correspondingly, legislative effectiveness – is dependent on the incentives of the ministers themselves to answer a given query. I hypothesize that regime-selected technocrats are disincentivized to respond to queries, given their importance for attracting electoral support. I test this hypothesis using data on ministry responsiveness in the Moroccan parliament, using both matching and difference-in-differences approaches to show that ministers with partisan affiliations are more likely to answer requests posed by legislative deputies than technocrats selected by the regime. The results imply that outside (partisan) participation in government helps to facilitate institutions of horizontal accountability.</p>

    <p>How does the presence of an autocrat with unique authorities over the legislature affect distributional politics in what are otherwise democratic institutions? Under institutional autocracy, the autocrat exerts considerable control over government formation via manipulation of elections or executive authorities. And yet he relinquishes other powers – namely, the ability to enact laws – to elected legislatures that might include representatives from outside the regime. I consider the implications of two specific autocratic authorities: the ability to dismiss an elected legislature, necessitating new elections, and the ability to manipulate electoral results in his own favor. I construct a formal model of policy bargaining in an autocratic context, drawing on approaches used in democratic settings. I find that the ability to dismiss the legislature alone creates an incentive for other players to include the autocrat in governing coalitions, since it is only by including him that they ensure coalitional stability and retain the benefits of rule. This, in turn, creates a distributional distortion in the autocrat’s favor, as he is assured of access to proposal power. If institutions are binding, such that the autocrat’s decision to dismiss the legislature is linked to his support for policy proposals, members of the ruling coalition have an incentive to include him in their policy proposals, and the autocrat’s expected payoff is greater relative to a game in which he votes separately on policy and coalition dissolution. In both cases, payoffs are asymmetrically distributed in the autocrat’s favor relative to a democratic setting.</p>

    <p>Do existing theories regarding the impact of foreign migration explain preferences in non-OECD countries? I test explanations for opposition to migration using a survey experiment implemented in Qatar. The results offer a rare validation of predictions from the labor market competition model, demonstrating that individual employment circumstances are important preference determinants. Additionally, while OECD citizens prefer high-skilled migrants, Qataris are indifferent between white and blue-collar workers. Mediation analysis suggests that this null effect is the result of competing concerns over the impact of differing classes of migrants on economic and social welfare. Qatar’s unique context provides a critical test case of the labor market hypothesis, and these findings demonstrate the importance of testing theoretical explanations in a diverse set of contexts.</p>

    <p>Air pollution is a vexing problem for emerging countries that strike a delicate balance between environmental protection, health, and energy for growth. We examine these difficulties in a study of disparate levels of exposure to pollution from coal-fired power generation in India, a country with high levels of air pollution and large, marginalized populations. With data on coal plant locations, atmospheric conditions, and census demographics, we estimate exposure to coal plant emissions using models that predict particle transportation. We find that ethnic and poor populations are more likely to be exposed to coal pollution. However, this relationship is sometimes non-linear and follows an inverted u-shape similar to that of an Environmental Kuznets Curve. We theorize that this non-linear relationship is due to the exclusion of marginalized communities from both the negative and positive externalities of industrial development.</p>

    <p>Does political alignment at different levels of government influence centralized bureaucratic processes? Environmental clearances are important regulatory tools that allow governments to target the distribution of public goods/bads by both controlling negative externalities and allocating rents from project developers. While commentators advocate for central authorities to control environmental licensing of major projects, in emerging markets with weak formal institutions it is still possible for local politicians to influence this process. We use data on environmental clearances in India for thermal (primarily coal-fired) power plants between the years 2004-2014 to test whether local legislators influence an otherwise bureaucratic process in which they play no formal role. Using a regression discontinuity design, we find that partisan alignment with the state chief minister results in a sharp increase in local clearance applications. This is consistent with the hypothesis that political alignment “greases the wheels” of bureaucracy by facilitating more environmental approvals, rather than creating an additional barrier to entry. Our results contribute to a growing literature that suggests that lower-level politicians can still exert influence on the policy process despite having few institutionalized powers.</p>
