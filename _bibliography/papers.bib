  abstract = {How do civilians respond to civil war narratives? Do they react to ethnic frames more strongly than to alternatives? Governments and rebels battle for hearts and minds as well as strategic terrain, and winning the narrative war can shift legitimacy, popular support, and material resources to the sympathetically framed side. We examine the effect of one‐sided and competing war discourses on ordinary people's understandings of the Syrian civil war—a conflict with multiple narratives, but which has become more communal over time. We conduct a framing experiment with a representative sample of Syrian refugees in Lebanon in which we vary the narrative that describes the reasons for the conflict. We find that sectarian explanations, framed in isolation, strongly increase the importance government supporters place on fighting. When counterframed against competing narratives, however, the rallying effect of sectarianism drops and vanishes.},

  abstract = {Primary elections are increasingly popular around the world, but historically political parties have typically chosen their candidate selection mechanisms in a decentralized
manner. We develop a theory that accounts for variations in the use of primary elections in these settings. In our model, two parties choose candidates for general elections
over an infinite horizon. Each party has an elite and a non-elite faction, where the elite
faction can choose whether to hold primaries or nominate itself. Primaries produce
more electable candidates, but losing a primary also deprives elites of private goods
and future elite status. The model predicts that parties adopt primaries under high
ideological polarization or when they are electorally disadvantaged. Additionally, we
show how rigidities in the ability of winners to change candidate selection mechanisms
can increase the universal adoption of primaries in electorally volatile environments.},
